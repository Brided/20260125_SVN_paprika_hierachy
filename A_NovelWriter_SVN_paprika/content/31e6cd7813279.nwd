@time: Time_StudentYears

%Short: Flashback to late nights studying with Gerald during university.

- Before the flashback begins:

n_thought "He's helping now… Just like he helped back then…"

- Flashback begins:

n_narrate "_(It's late at night in our university dorm room. Books and papers are scattered across the desk.)_"
n_narrate "_(Gerald is sitting next to me, patiently explaining a difficult concept.)_"

n_thought "Affection…"

g “Desire wants something from someone. Affection is… staying, even when you don’t.”
g “If you only stay because you want something, that’s not affection. Affection’s what’s left when wanting quiets down.”

n_narrate "_(Gerald smiles reassuringly as I finally grasp the concept.)_"

n "That's… actually really helpful, Gerald. Thanks."

n_thought "Did he just… smile at me?"
n_thought "Why did he smile like that?"
n_thought "Was that…"
n_thought "… Affection?"

- Flashback ends:

n_thought "I stayed silent for too long… and yet he keeps helping."
n_thought "Does he want me?"
n_thought "Was I ready?"

n_narrate "_(I just pause, reflecting on the memory.)_"
g "You coming, Nicolas?"
n "… Yeah, just a sec."

n_narrate "_(I sigh deeply, then stand up, ready to go meet Nathan with Gerald.)_"

n_thought "Am I ready?"
