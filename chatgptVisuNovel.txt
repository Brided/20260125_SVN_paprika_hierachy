1️⃣ Top-level “dish”: the visual novel

The VN itself is a dish, composed of multiple recipes:

- Story / Plot
- Characters
- Dialogue & Choices
- Scenes & Backgrounds
- Sprites & Animations
- Audio (music, SFX)
- UI / Dialogue boxes
- Branching / State system

Each of these is a level 0 ingredient.

2️⃣ Level -1 ingredients (what builds the level 0 items)

Level 0	                     Level -1 Ingredients

- Story / Plot               Chapters → Scenes → Paragraphs / Beats
- Characters	               Name, Personality, Sprite set, Voice
- Dialogue & Choices	       Lines, Choices, Branch targets, Flags
- Scenes & Backgrounds	     Background art, Props, Camera angles
- Sprites & Animations       Poses, Expressions, Animations, Rig
- Audio	                     Music tracks, SFX clips, Voice lines
- UI / Dialogue boxes	       Box graphics, Fonts, Colors, Layout
- Branching / State system	 Variables, Flags, Event triggers
  
3️⃣ Level -2 ingredients (leaf units)

Keep breaking down until you reach atomic units you can finish in isolation:

Level -1	             Leaf units (finishable)

- Paragraph / Beat	   Single sentence / line
- Sprite set	         Single sprite / single pose / single expression
- Animation	           Single keyframe / small loop / one action
- Background	         One image layer / sky / wall / prop
- Music track	         One loop, one instrument / stem
- Choice	             One decision option
- Flag / Variable	     Boolean, integer, or string
- Dialogue box	       One visual template / color / font

4️⃣ Recursive insight

Each leaf unit can be finished independently.
Level -1 ingredients are “interfaces” or small recipes combining leaves.
Level 0 items are composed of several level -1 ingredients, often mocked at first.
The full VN is just one big recipe combining all level 0 items.

5️⃣ Mocking in recipe terms

Leaf units = actual ingredients (real sugar, flour, salt)
Level -1 recipes = test bowls / mixtures (might use substitutes)
Level 0 = main dish assembly (VN logic)
Full VN = plated, served meal
