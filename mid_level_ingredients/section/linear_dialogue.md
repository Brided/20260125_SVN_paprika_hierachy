## Description
This section encompasses dialogue exchanges that follow a linear progression, where characters take turns speaking in a straightforward manner. It is designed for scenarios where the conversation flows naturally without branching paths or complex interactions.
**Input**: Character profiles, dialogue lines, narrative text
**Process**: Present dialogue lines in sequence → Manage character turns → Display narrative descriptions as needed
**Output**: Dialogue lines displayed to the player, character states updated

## Composition
- Initiate Dialogue → start the conversation between characters
- Character Turns → alternate speaking turns between characters
- Narrative Descriptions → provide context or setting as needed
- Conclude Dialogue → end the conversation appropriately
- May lead into other sections such as "Ask / Interact" for more complex interactions

# Considerations
- Simplest form of dialogue to write and implement
- May lack depth compared to interactive dialogue sections
