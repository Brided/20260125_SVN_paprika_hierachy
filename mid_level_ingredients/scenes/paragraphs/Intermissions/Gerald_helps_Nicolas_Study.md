n_narrate "_(Gerald is sitting next to me, patiently explaining a difficult concept.)_"

n_thought "Affection…"

g “Desire wants something from someone. Affection is… staying, even when you don’t.”
g “If you only stay because you want something, that’s not affection. Affection’s what’s left when wanting quiets down.”

n_narrate "_(Gerald smiles reassuringly as I finally grasp the concept.)_"

n "That's… actually really helpful, Gerald. Thanks."

n_thought "Did he just… smile at me?"
