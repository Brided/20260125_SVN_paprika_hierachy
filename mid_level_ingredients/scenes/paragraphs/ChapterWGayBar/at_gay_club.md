g "Of course! This is just the kind of place we need to be right now."
g "Look all around us, many places for people like us to be themselves."
n "I guess you're right. It's just... a bit overwhelming."

n "…"
n "How… how can red light districts even exist?"
n "I mean, isn't there ongoing debates on exploitation and human trafficking?"
