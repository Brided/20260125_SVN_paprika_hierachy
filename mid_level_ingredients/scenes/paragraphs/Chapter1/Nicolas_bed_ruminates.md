%Short: Nicolas lies in bed, ruminating about his life.

In: Scene 1.1 (Before Texting Friends Section)

## Description
Nicolas is lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, feeling purpose-less and lonely. He laments on how he has no job, that he is nothing, and has no motivation to do anything. Suddenly, he gets the idea of just talking to people he finds interesting. He decides to text some of his friends, especially Gerald, to see their reaction and to know where they are in life.
