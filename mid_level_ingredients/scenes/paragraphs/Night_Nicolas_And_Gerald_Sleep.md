n_narrate "_(I woke up in the middle of the night.)_"
n_narrate "_(Gerald is lying next to me, sound asleep.)_"

n_thought "He's sound asleep…"
n_thought "I wonder what he's dreaming about…"
n_thought "Maybe about us…"

n_thought "I feel so… close to him right now."
n_thought "If I could just reach out and hold him…"
n_thought "But I don't want to wake him up…"

n_thought "I hope he feels the same way about me."
n_thought "I want to be with him…"
n_thought "…"
n_thought "Do I?"
n_thought "I don't know…"
n_thought "Maybe I should just enjoy this moment."

- Gerald twitches slightly in his sleep.

n_thought "I wonder why he just simply accepted to be there with me, like that."
n_thought "Was he just being polite?"
n_thought "He accepted to come to my apartment so easily…"
n_thought "He accepted to sleep in the same bed as me…"
n_thought "Maybe he just feels sorry for me…"

n_thought "Maybe he feels lonely too…"
n_thought "Or maybe he just likes me…"
n_thought "I should tell him how I feel…"

n_thought "But what if he doesn't feel the same way?"
n_thought "He was… looking at me differently earlier."
n_thought "Maybe I misread the situation…"

n_thought "Maybe he just outright hates me…"
n_thought "No, that's not true…"
n_thought "He wouldn't have come here if he did…"
n_thought "He wouldn't…"
n_thought "He…"

- He falls asleep.
