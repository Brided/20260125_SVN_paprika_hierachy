# Ideas For Other Things

Ideas that may arise while working on this project, that fit other projects better.

## Dirty Visual Novel

An adult-themed visual novel, with romance and explicit content. This explores mature relationships and scenarios, focusing on character development and emotional depth alongside the adult themes.
In a location such as a nightclub, bar, or private setting, player chooses between different characters to interact with, the characters have storylines cut into chapters that can be pursued, leading to various romantic or intimate encounters.

First chapters of some characters may be the POV character meeting the character, explaining how they came to know the chosen character. Such chapters may be optional, allowing players to skip directly into the "spicy" content if they choose. If a character has no such character, then the POV character meets them directly in the "spicy" chapter, without prior interaction. Aka, a mix of characters the POV knows and characters they meet for the first time in the "spicy" chapter.

## Story that starts with a prophecy

A story that begins with a prophecy foretelling the meeting of two male characters who will bring truth and enlightenment to their world. The prophecy speaks of their union as a catalyst for change.

The story would be set in:
a ruined world?
a ruined rebuilt world?
a fantasy world?

The two come from antipodal places on the planet, one from rainforests, the other from icy tundras.

## Story that doesn't tell you anything

A story that intentionally withholds information from the reader, creating a sense of mystery and ambiguity. The narrative would focus on the characters' experiences and emotions, leaving much to interpretation.

## Visual novel story where the reader is a character in the story

Visual novel story where the reader is a character in the story, not necessarily the main one and not influenced by reader, the reader character would be a set one but not to rigid to match the reader.

## Gimmick: Being sensual without saying it outright, subtle

A story that uses subtle hints and descriptions to convey sensuality without explicit language, yet it still reads very sensually. This could involve focusing on sensory details, body language, and emotional connections between characters to create an intimate atmosphere.

## Story with way too much display of affection and tender loving care than explicit scenes

A story that emphasizes affection, tenderness, and emotional intimacy between characters, with minimal explicit content. The focus would be on the development of relationships through caring gestures, loving interactions, and deep emotional bonds.

## Story where the main character is the only one left on the planet

A story where the main character is the last person on Earth, exploring themes of isolation. Would be explored: how they cope with loneliness, their mental state, their lost loved ones, their daily routines and survival, and their reflections on personhood and existence.

## Character concept: Crow of oceanic depths

A crow from the deep ocean.
- "Wise caw of the depths"

## Story where main character is a human, desperately wants anthropomorphic animals to exist

POV desperately wants anthropomorphic animals to exist instead of the "boring", "bland" humans.
POV is a lonely person, feels disconnected from other humans, and finds solace in the idea.
