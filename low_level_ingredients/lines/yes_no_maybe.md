Yes No Maybe

# Line: Agreement

@tag: Line_Agreement

%Short: "yes", "sure", "absolutely", or similar affirmative response from a character

## Description
A character expresses agreement or consent to a proposal, suggestion, or statement made by another character. This line can be used to indicate willingness to participate in an activity, acceptance of an idea, or general affirmation in a conversation.

Can be a choice the player makes for a character to agree to something, the POV character saying it by themselves, or a line delivered by a non-player character in response to a prompt.



# Line: Disagreement

@tag: Line_Disagreement

%Short: "no", "never", "not at all", or similar negative response from a character

## Description
A character expresses disagreement or refusal in response to a proposal, suggestion, or statement made by another character. This line can be used to indicate unwillingness to participate in an activity, rejection of an idea, or general negation in a conversation.

Can be a choice the player makes for a character to refuse something, the POV character saying it by themselves, or a line delivered by a non-player character in response to a prompt.

Player: If “No” is not among the available options, the “But Thou Must!” trope is in effect, and the request will happen.
Meaning: The POV character, in reality, does not want to refuse.



# Line: Uncertainty

@tag: Line_Uncertainty

%Short: "maybe", "perhaps", "I guess", or similar non-committal response from a character

## Description

A character expresses uncertainty or indecision in response to a proposal, suggestion, or statement made by another character. This line can be used to indicate hesitation to participate in an activity, ambivalence towards an idea, or general non-commitment in a conversation.

Can be a choice the player makes for a character to respond uncertainly, the POV character saying it by themselves, or a line delivered by a non-player character in response to a prompt.

Maybe will never be accepted in situations that require a definitive yes or no. If chosen, loop back to the choice or prompt until a clear answer is given.
