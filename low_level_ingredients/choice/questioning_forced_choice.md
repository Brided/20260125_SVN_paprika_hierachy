# Choice: Forced Choice

@tag: Line_ForcedChoice

%Short: Choice appears optional, but option is inevitable

## Description
This unit represents a story beat where the player is presented with a choice that appears to allow for different outcomes, but in reality, all options lead to the same result. This is often used to create the illusion of agency while ensuring that a specific narrative event occurs regardless of the player's selection.
**input**:
Choice options ("Yes", "Maybe", "No"), remove "Yes" or "No" as needed
Or list of options
**Process**:
- Player selects A → outcome occurs
- Player selects other option → loops back to prompt, remove selected option
- Repeat until desired option is left
**Output**: A definitive outcome occurs

## Notes
- Illustrates the **“But Thou Must!”** trope, POV character genuinely wants the outcome
- Can include internal thoughts, hesitation, or playful reluctance in dialogue
- Useful for maintaining story flow when refusal is impossible
